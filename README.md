To create Python code that would support the requirements of this job description, we can break it down into several tasks and steps that align with GoHighLevel automation workflows, AI-enhanced features, and integrations with other tools. The code provided below won't directly interact with GoHighLevel's proprietary platform, but it will demonstrate how Python can be used to interact with APIs, automate tasks, and integrate with third-party tools, such as Zapier or Make.com.
High-Level Workflow for GoHighLevel Expert Role

    API Integration with GoHighLevel: Using GoHighLevel's API to fetch or send data to the platform.
    Automation & Workflow Creation: Using Python to trigger workflows based on data inputs.
    AI-enhanced Features: Implementing machine learning or AI for decision-making, e.g., automatically tagging leads or sending personalized responses.
    Third-party Integration: Automating tasks using third-party APIs, such as syncing GoHighLevel with other tools (like Google Sheets, CRMs, etc.).

Sample Python Code Outline

Here is an example of Python code that integrates with GoHighLevel’s API, demonstrates AI-enhanced features, and connects to other automation tools.

import requests
import json

# GoHighLevel API Configuration (Replace with actual API Key and Endpoint)
GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
GOHIGHLEVEL_API_URL = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/"
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Function to Get Client Information from GoHighLevel
def get_client_info(client_id):
    url = f"{GOHIGHLEVEL_API_URL}clients/{client_id}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Return client data
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Function to Create a New Lead in GoHighLevel
def create_new_lead(lead_data):
    url = f"{GOHIGHLEVEL_API_URL}leads"
    response = requests.post(url, json=lead_data, headers=HEADERS)
    
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print(f"Lead created successfully: {response.json()}")
    else:
        print(f"Error creating lead: {response.status_code}")

# Example AI-enhanced Lead Scoring (Basic Example)
def ai_lead_scoring(lead_data):
    # Implement AI logic (this is a simple threshold-based approach)
    score = 0
    if lead_data.get("interest_level") > 7:
        score += 5
    if lead_data.get("budget") > 5000:
        score += 3
    if lead_data.get("contact_frequency") > 3:
        score += 2
    
    # Return lead score (this could be more complex with actual AI models)
    return score

# Function to Trigger GoHighLevel Workflow Based on Lead Score
def trigger_workflow(lead_score, lead_id):
    # Workflow conditions
    if lead_score > 8:
        print(f"Lead {lead_id} is high quality. Triggering sales workflow.")
        # Trigger sales funnel or automation
        # You can call GoHighLevel API to trigger specific workflows here
        # Example API endpoint for workflows: /workflows/{workflow_id}/trigger
    elif lead_score > 5:
        print(f"Lead {lead_id} is medium quality. Triggering nurturing workflow.")
        # Trigger nurturing workflow
    else:
        print(f"Lead {lead_id} is low quality. No action taken.")

# Example Workflow Trigger using a Third-Party Tool (Zapier or Make.com)
def trigger_zapier_workflow(lead_data):
    zapier_webhook_url = "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/your_zapier_webhook_url"
    response = requests.post(zapier_webhook_url, json=lead_data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Successfully triggered Zapier workflow.")
    else:
        print(f"Error triggering Zapier workflow: {response.status_code}")

# Main Function to Create a Lead, Score it, and Trigger Workflow
def main():
    lead_data = {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com",
        "interest_level": 8,
        "budget": 10000,
        "contact_frequency": 4
    }
    
    lead_score = ai_lead_scoring(lead_data)
    create_new_lead(lead_data)  # Create the lead in GoHighLevel
    trigger_workflow(lead_score, lead_data["email"])  # Trigger GoHighLevel workflow
    
    # Optionally trigger a Zapier workflow
    trigger_zapier_workflow(lead_data)

# Running the Main Function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation of Code:

    API Integration with GoHighLevel:
        get_client_info: Fetches information about a client from GoHighLevel using its API.
        create_new_lead: Creates a new lead in GoHighLevel using the provided lead data.
    AI-enhanced Lead Scoring:
        ai_lead_scoring: A simple AI-based approach to scoring leads. You can integrate a real machine learning model for this task (e.g., using scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to analyze the lead data more deeply.
    Triggering GoHighLevel Workflows:
        trigger_workflow: Based on the lead score, this triggers a specific workflow, like sending the lead to a sales team or a nurturing sequence.
    Third-Party Integrations:
        trigger_zapier_workflow: Sends lead data to Zapier (or Make.com) using a webhook URL. Zapier can then trigger additional workflows, like sending an email or pushing the lead to another system.

Qualifications:

    Proven expertise in building advanced workflows, automations, and funnels in GoHighLevel.
    AI-enhanced feature implementation (such as the basic lead scoring AI in the example).
    Experience integrating third-party tools like Zapier.
    Strong understanding of GoHighLevel API for customizations.

To Apply:

If you are interested in applying for the position, please provide:

    A brief introduction about your background and why you’re interested in this role.
    Relevant experience with GoHighLevel and its API.
    Examples of advanced workflows, automations, or customizations you have built in GoHighLevel.
    Your availability and hourly rate.
